        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p><img src="images/story.jpeg" alt="Our Story">
            Safe Haven Animal Shelter began with a simple, heartfelt mission: to be a voice for the voiceless.
            Founded by a group of passionate animal advocates in the heart of Houston, our nonprofit was created
            to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome animals who have been neglected, abused, or abandoned. What
            started as a small effort to make a difference in the lives of a few quickly grew into a full-scale
            operation, providing a safe, loving refuge for animals in desperate need. Every dog, cat, and
            companion that comes through our doors receives medical care, emotional healing, and a second chance
            at life. At Safe Haven, we believe every animal deserves a home—and we work tirelessly to make that
            a reality, one rescue at a time.</p>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p><img src="images/mission.jpeg" alt="Our Mission">
            At Safe Haven Animal Shelter, our mission is to provide compassionate care and a second chance for
            animals in need. We are committed to rescuing homeless, neglected, abused, and abandoned animals
            throughout the Houston area, ensuring they receive the medical attention, rehabilitation, and love
            they deserve. Our dedicated team works tirelessly to heal both physically and emotionally, preparing
            these animals for their forever homes. Beyond rescue, we focus on community outreach, education, and
            promoting responsible pet ownership to reduce the number of animals in need. Through our responsible
            adoption practices and advocacy, we aim to create a more humane world—one where every animal is not
            only safe but also valued, respected, and given the chance to thrive in a loving, permanent home.
            Together, we are building a brighter future for animals in our community and beyond.</p>

        <h3>What we offer</h3>
        <p><img src="images/offer.jpeg" alt="What we Offer">
            Safe Haven Animal Shelter offers a comprehensive range of services to support both animals and the
            community. We provide emergency rescue and shelter for animals in crisis, along with veterinary care,
            spay/neuter services, and behavioral rehabilitation to prepare them for adoption. Our adoption
            program carefully matches each animal with a loving, responsible home, while our foster network
            provides temporary care for pets in need of extra support. We also offer educational resources,
            volunteer opportunities, and community outreach programs aimed at promoting responsible pet ownership
            and preventing animal cruelty. At Safe Haven, we’re more than a shelter—we’re a lifeline for animals
            and a resource for the people who care about them.</p>
